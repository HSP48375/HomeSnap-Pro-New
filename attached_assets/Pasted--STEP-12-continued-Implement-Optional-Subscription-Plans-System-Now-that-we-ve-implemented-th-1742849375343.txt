### STEP 12 (continued): Implement Optional Subscription Plans System

Now that we've implemented the Interactive Onboarding Experience, please create the Optional Subscription Plans System, which will exist alongside the standard pay-per-use model:

1. Create a SubscriptionPlansScreen.tsx that clearly presents subscriptions as an optional alternative to pay-per-use:
   - Add an intro section explaining: "Choose what works for you: Pay-per-use with no commitment, or save up to 56% with our monthly subscription plans"
   - Include a toggle or tab system to compare "Pay-Per-Use" vs "Subscription Plans"
   - Emphasize the flexibility to switch between models at any time
   
   Display these subscription tiers:
