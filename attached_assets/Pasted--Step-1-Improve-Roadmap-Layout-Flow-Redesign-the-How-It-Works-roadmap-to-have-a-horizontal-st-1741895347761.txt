ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Improve Roadmap Layout & Flow
Redesign the "How It Works" roadmap to have a horizontal step-by-step flow instead of the current layout.
Each step should be connected sequentially with smooth, glowing arrows or lines to make the flow clear.
Ensure readabilityâ€”each step should be easy to scan at a glance.
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Modernize Icons & Styling
Replace outdated icons with modern vector-style icons that look professional and sleek.
Apply subtle hover animations (e.g., a small glow or pulse effect) when users hover over a step.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Enhance Visual Appeal
Increase contrast between the background and the stepsâ€”use cyber-tech gradients or glowing effects for depth.
The final step (Receive Photos in <12 Hours) should be more visually prominentâ€”make it stand out with a special effect, like a larger size or glowing border.
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Improve Background & Transitions
Add a slight neon glow behind each step for a futuristic, high-tech feel.
Make the path between steps animated (if possible) to guide the userâ€™s eye smoothly.

Adjust the spacing and alignment to make the steps flow logically and clearly, with smooth animated arrows connecting each step.
ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Highlight the Final Step
